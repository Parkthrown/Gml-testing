Only code (gml, and shader files) from the project are uploaded here, thus making it dead code that exists solely for evaluating purposes.
 
None of the actual game assets will ever be uploaded here

There are several dead functions with inconsistent casing that will be removed from the main project.

the current casing for the project is snake_case for scripts and snake_camelCase for the rest of resources.

The most important parts for every folder:

  objects:

  obj_ambientManager
  obj_heightMap
  obj_mainMenu
  Wax

  shaders:

  sh_lightEngine
  sh_vignette
  sh_forcedPalette

  scripts:

  fsm_*
  wax_*
  pragma*
  ambient_draw_lighting
  sword_*
  lw_*
  tile_*
  collison*
  collide*
